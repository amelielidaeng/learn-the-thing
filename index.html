    <h2>a frontend diary</h2>
    <h4>monday 17jan22</h4> 
    <p>Today we had the introduction for FrontEnd Development at Sundsgården. 
        I am <strong>super excited!</strong> It took a lot less time than anticipated so I had 
        the chance to call CSN regarding paperwork and catch up on coursework 
        from Textilhögskolan. 
        Mom picked up Lo so I had a couple of hours to finish a few quizes and do some 
        planning. Everything feels better with a plan. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Had falafels and mashed potatoes for dinner. Surprisingly tasty 
        combination.
    </p>   
        <br>
    <h4>tuesday 18jan22</h4>
    <p>I had a really long day. Just a really long day. Had the laundry 
        room booked and it was my turn to drop Lo off at daycare. 
        Went home and finished a few assignments for the courses at 
        Textilhögskolan. I dropped Lo at her grandma after daycare 
        and went to the dentist and had him <del>steal all of my money</del> <ins>fix 
        my cavaties</ins>. He was very nice and polished of my coffe stains 
        while waiting for the anesthesia to kick in.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ate pasta with zucchini, tomates and sallad. Lo only wanted to eat the 
        tomatoes and parmesan. I couldn't feel half of my mouth so it was a 
        gamble to try to chew (I'm very brave ok). 
    </p>

    <h4>wednesday 19jan22</h4>
    <p>Hardly slept due to a child that did not sleep, so that was ""fun"". Work 
        today - 8 days in a row then I get a couple of days off. I have less 
        than 2 weeks left now. I'm gonna miss my colleagues and the chat and 
        Fika Fridays. I'm also gonna miss that joke of a program, Amadeus. 
        I actually feel kinda sad that I don't get a chance to work more 
        with Amadeus and to properly learn it. Not gonna lie, will not miss the fear of 
        hitting ER instead of RT. I don't know what they were thinking when 
        they put the save command next to the retrieve command when nothing is 
        reversible. There is no <kbd>ctrl+z</kbd> in the flight booking 
        business. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Tried to understand Git but I didn't. Gonna have to google Git for 
        dummies. Made myself a <a href="https://github.com/amelielidaeng">Github 
        profile</a> and played around with some HTML which was fun! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Made tacos for dinner. Lo only wanted to eat the tomatoes, corn and 
        cheese. Zo wanted to eat everything but since she is a dog she was 
        not allowed. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>thursday 20jan22</h4>
    <p>Work today as well. Hardly any calls are coming in, so I can study 
        and write my little journal  and try some fun html stuff. Notice my 
        pretty little font-y things!. Gonna need to write a whole-ass 
        assignment for Textilhögskolan today so I can cash in a few points. 
        I am trying very hard to lower my standard a bit, stop being a 
        perfectionist and just write something - anything. Still waiting for 
        documentation to arrive so I can convince CSN to give me money again.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm trying to learn more about html, reading up on the basics and 
        bookmarking pages that seem like helpful resources. 
        <br>
        <br>
        No one told me that 90% of parenting is deciding what everyone in 
        the family will be eating and then preparing and making it. With 
        that said, I have no idea what I'm cooking tonight.
